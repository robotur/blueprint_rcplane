RC Airplane Project for Hack Club Blueprint

This project is a low-cost, fixed-wing RC airplane designed around a single MT2204 2300KV brushless motor. The goal is to learn practical aerodynamics, propulsion sizing, radio control systems, and basic flight electronics while staying within a strict budget.

The airplane uses a 3S LiPo battery, a 30A ESC, metal-gear micro servos for control surfaces, and a FlySky 6-channel transmitter/receiver for manual flight control. All parts were selected for affordability, availability, and beginner-friendliness.

The aircraft is intended for stable flight testing, basic maneuvers, and future expansion (such as adding a microcontroller or flight stabilization).
